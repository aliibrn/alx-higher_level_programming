# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

Welcome to the first step in your Python programming journey! This folder serves as an introduction to the Python programming language, covering fundamental concepts and providing hands-on practice through various tasks. By the end of this project, you will have a solid foundation in Python and a better understanding of scripting, string manipulation, and basic programming principles.

## What You Will Learn
- How to write and execute Python scripts.
- The importance of adhering to coding standards (e.g., pycodestyle).
- Basic Python syntax and operations.
- String manipulation and formatting.
- Working with variables, floats, and integers.
- Introduction to scripting in Bash.
- Understanding and applying the Zen of Python.
- Solving an interview-style question in C.

## File Descriptions

### Shell Scripts
- **[0-run](0-run)**: A shell script that runs a Python script. The Python script file name is passed as an argument.
- **[1-run_inline](1-run_inline)**: A shell script that runs Python code provided inline.

### Python Scripts
- **[2-print.py](2-print.py)**: A Python script that prints the exact phrase: `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"`, followed by a new line.
- **[3-print_number.py](3-print_number.py)**: A Python program that prints an integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by the text `Battery street` and a new line.
- **[4-print_float.py](4-print_float.py)**: A Python program that prints a float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 decimal places.
- **[5-print_string.py](5-print_string.py)**: A Python program that prints a string stored in the variable `str` three times, followed by its first 9 characters.
- **[6-concat.py](6-concat.py)**: A Python program that concatenates two strings to print the message: `Welcome to Holberton School!`.
- **[7-edges.py](7-edges.py)**: A Python program that demonstrates string slicing by printing specific parts of a given string.
- **[8-concat_edges.py](8-concat_edges.py)**: A Python program that manipulates and concatenates parts of a string to print: `object-oriented programming with Python`, followed by a new line.
- **[9-easter_egg.py](9-easter_egg.py)**: A Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, a collection of guiding principles for writing Pythonic code.

### Advanced Tasks
- **[10-check_cycle.c](10-check_cycle.c)**: An interview-style question implemented in C. This program defines a function that checks if a singly linked list contains a cycle.
- **[100-write.py](100-write.py)**: A Python script that prints the exact phrase: `and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
- **[101-compile](101-compile)**: A shell script that compiles a Python script file into bytecode.
- **[102-magic_calculation.py](102-magic_calculation.py)**: A Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b):` that replicates the behavior of a given bytecode.

### Header File
- **[lists.h](lists.h)**: A header file containing the function prototype for `10-check_cycle.c`.
