# Python - Classes and Objects

![Object-Oriented Programming Meme](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-higher-level_programming+/247/oop-meme.jpg)

Welcome to the world of **Object-Oriented Programming** in Python! This project dives deep into the concepts of classes and objects, empowering you to write cleaner, reusable, and modular code. You'll explore attributes, methods, properties, and the principles of data abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding.

## Project Overview :sparkles:

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. Each task builds upon the previous one, gradually introducing new concepts and features to enhance your understanding.

## What's Inside? :open_file_folder:

### **Tests**
- **[tests](./tests)**: A folder containing test files to validate the functionality of your code. Provided by Holberton School.

### **Tasks**
1. **My First Square**  
  - **[0-square.py](./0-square.py)**: A simple Python class `Square` that defines a square.

2. **Square with Size**  
  - **[1-square.py](./1-square.py)**: Adds a private instance attribute `size` and instantiation with `size`.

3. **Size Validation**  
  - **[2-square.py](./2-square.py)**: Validates `size` with type and value checks.

4. **Area of a Square**  
  - **[3-square.py](./3-square.py)**: Introduces a method to calculate the area of the square.

5. **Access and Update Private Attribute**  
  - **[4-square.py](./4-square.py)**: Adds property methods to retrieve and update `size`.

6. **Printing a Square**  
  - **[5-square.py](./5-square.py)**: Prints the square using the `#` character.

7. **Coordinates of a Square**  
  - **[6-square.py](./6-square.py)**: Adds a `position` attribute with validation.

## Why Learn OOP? :thinking:

Object-Oriented Programming is a cornerstone of modern software development. It allows you to:
- Model real-world entities as code.
- Write modular and maintainable programs.
- Reuse code efficiently through inheritance and polymorphism.

## Get Started :rocket:

Clone this repository and start exploring the tasks. Each script is a stepping stone to mastering OOP in Python. Happy coding!
